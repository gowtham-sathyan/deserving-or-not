We have another accident to adjudicate.” On 1500 Graduate Lane a car crash has taken place and Mr. Charles Ponzi is claiming his insurance for the incurred damages. You have a couple of days to investigate the accident and determine if Insuricare is liable and has to compensate Mr. Ponzi. The car has been towed and taken to Insuricare’s garage for inspection. Since the garage is swamped, it will take three days for you to get the car’s report. Meanwhile, there is a bag of evidence waiting for you at the scene of the accident with just a pocket knife and a purchase bill from DrinkOLot Bar that was found in the car before the accident.","\n","^Use your clues and time wisely, Frank, and submit a report determining if we must shell out money for yet another driver.","\n",{"->":"investigation"},["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"investigation":[["^<h4> So.. how would you like to begin the investigation? </h4>","\n","ev","str","^Go to DrinkOLot bar to investigate","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Talk to the victim Mr. Ponzi and record his statement","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"alcohol"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"victimstatement"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"alcohol":[["^Frank: “This is a pretty shady bar, I must say!”.","\n","^It’s 11 am.
